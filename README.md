Simulation of my stock-and-flow model of the Lions Gate Hospital ER dept in North Vancouver, BC

Earlier in 02024, I visited the Lions Gate Hospital ER and observed some basic dynamics, which I then sketched into a stock-and-flow model (originally published at https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7169051451015487489-9u6-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

My goal here is to add to the model, simulate and observe them for strategic recommendations. I'll be using PySD (but could have opted for R's deSolve -- open to collaborate with anyone either way).
