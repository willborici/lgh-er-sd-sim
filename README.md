# Simulation of the stocks-and-flows model of the Lions Gate Hospital ER
Simulation of my stock-and-flow model of the Lions Gate Hospital ER dept in North Vancouver, BC

Earlier in 02024, I visited the Lions Gate Hospital ER and observed some basic dynamics, which I then sketched into a stock-and-flow model (originally published at https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7169051451015487489-9u6-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

My goal here is to add to the model, simulate and observe them for strategic recommendations. I'll be using PySD (but could have opted for R's deSolve -- open to collaborate with anyone either way).

Necessary packages: pip install pysd numpy matplotlib

## Disclaimer: Simulation of Emergency Room Dynamics

This repository contains a simulation of emergency room system dynamics based on generalized models and my assumptions and observations from my several visits. The purpose of this simulation is purely educational and research-oriented, with the hope that as the model grows closer to reality it can make life easy for everyone.

The simulation does not represent the specific operational procedures or dynamics of any particular hospital, including Lions Gate Hospital. Any resemblance to actual emergency room operations or protocols is coincidental. This simulation is not intended for operational use or decision-making related to medical emergencies.

### Usage and Liability:

- Users of this simulation are solely responsible for its interpretation and use.
- The author(s) of this repository are not liable for any damages or issues arising from the use or misuse of this simulation.
- It is recommended to consult with appropriate medical professionals and hospital authorities for accurate information on emergency room dynamics.
